Hope:
Disregard the most exquisite headdress and matching dress on but still need to hold in our broken heart pieces as the life forces energy and blood drains out the body.  In the dance of Hope we reaching out on the tippy toes wanting our lives to go forward in hope of mending 

Forgiving:
The spikes of painful sorrow spikes grow out the skull as the beautiful headdress unravels we keep up the dance of letting go on our toes... with the arms wide-open in the acceptance of rushing water running through the torn gloves as the blood of life drips from the palm... or is that the paring of the stage curtain and the highly degsined glove for this dance?

Celebrate:
As the purple sheen of skin shine through the purity of the dress you danced with pieces of your headdress in receiving and sending life force energy of love. We dance on in the light of grace from the Devine.  Fully experience the blessings of the promise in the essence of design of being truest self
