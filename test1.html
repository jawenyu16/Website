        <p>
          I am a science fiction writer and Star Trek geek, a teacher, a mother
          of three, a medical science enthusiast and a software developer. I am
          interested in code projects that combine any of my interests. I have
          worked on technical curriculum, mobile applications for health care,
          and games for creating plot outlines in fiction. I also write and

          People talk about how wonderful the world seems to children, and
          that's true enough. But children think they will grow into it and
          understand it, and I know very well that I will not, and would not if
          I had a dozen lives.
